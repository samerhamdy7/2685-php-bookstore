                Cats are among the most highly specialized of the flesh-eating mammals.Their brains are large and well
                developed.
                The cats teeth are adapted to three functions: stabbing (canines), anchoring (canines), and cutting
                (molars).
                There is a remarkable mechanism for retracting the cats claws when they are not in use.
                Cats have excellent vision and hearing, with ears that can turn like satellite dishes.
                Cats are believed to be the only mammals who dont taste sweetness.
